Cory’s train ran late on Sunday morning.  I waited in the car outside of the station, but eventually parked around the block to avoid two homeless men who were walking nearby.  They probably couldn’t care less about me, but the station was empty and I somehow felt powerless even as I sat in my large, locked vehicle.  I was thankful to hear the approach of the train, but surprised to see Cory come up the stairs with a large wheeled duffel bag.  We had planned to take some engagement photos after church, but did he really need to pack so many outfits?  Perhaps he lost his backpack?  An older woman with long, blond hair followed him up, carrying two more smaller bags.  Another homeless person.  But I couldn’t lock my doors and drive away from this one, because Cory set her bags in the trunk and invited her into the car.

I was cordial and began to drive the three of us to church, as our new friend was interested in attending with us and finding some help.  Meanwhile, my mind raced with questions.  Why today?  Doesn’t Cory realize that this is the day we are telling everyone at church that we are engaged?  How are we supposed to enjoy the excitement of our friends if we are also caring for a homeless woman?  What about the photoshoot afterward?  Couldn’t he have just offered for us to drop her off somewhere else?  

Stop.  

> While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.

Us, all of us.  God’s love was not sent just for Cory and me.  This woman needed some love, and it is Christ who died and rose again for her and us all.  We pray that she may one day know Christ’s love, and that we will always unlock the car doors for those who need it.
