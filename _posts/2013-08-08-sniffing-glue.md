Last night was the big night: the first mass mailing began!  Amy, one of my four beautiful bridesmaids, spent over 3 hours helping create 130 photo magnets.  Few friends are crazy enough to voluntary sniff glue with you for the entire night!  Thanks for being crazy, Amy!  Cory and I are excited to be officially announcing that we're getting married!  Keep an eye on your snail mailbox!
