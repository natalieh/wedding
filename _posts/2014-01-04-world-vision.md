There's only two weeks until the wedding! 

I (Cory) got an email a few days ago from one of the stores we're registered at. In the midst of trying to market to 
soon-to-be newlyweds who are already worried about having everything arranged for the wedding, it gave this piece of info:
"Most gifts are purchased in the two weeks before the wedding"

So, if you're reading this and you're coming to the wedding, chances are you haven't bought a gift yet! But this post
isn't a reminder to buy us a wedding present&#8210;it's actually to tell you about an exciting alternative to buying us a wedding gift
and shipping it or carrying it on your lap in a cramped airplane seat!

Natalie and I believe that our wedding is about more than just us. 
We have been blessed beyond measure with gifts, talents, financial means, and one another!
One of our highest aims in our marriage is to help one another to use these blessings to bless others--down the street, 
across town, and all over the world. For this reason, we are partnering with <a href="http://www.worldvision.org/">World Vision</a>,
a Christian humanitarian organization dedicated to improving the lives of people all over the world, regardless of religion,
racial, or ethnic boundaries. World Vision seeks to deal with the root causes of poverty and injustice by meeting physical
needs of communities in a sustainable way. These are things that Natalie and I feel very strongly about, and it would
mean a lot to us if you joined us in supporting them.

As we prepare to celebrate our marriage with you, we recognize that we have the ability to make a real, impactful, and sustainable difference.
Your money can be used to buy
medicine, food, wells, goats, books, and many other items contributing to the well-being of those in need
Any amount, no matter how small, would mean so much to us&#8210;much more than any set of towels or pots or cute fuzzy slippers.

To better serve those in need, we are matching all donations in honor of our marriage. 

So, before you buy that $80 body pillow and try to stuff it into the overhead compartment of the plane, please thoughtfully
consider giving to World Vision in lieu of a traditional wedding gift. Your partnership with us in meeting the needs of people
all over the world is more important to us than anything else. You can give online by visiting our <a href="http://support.worldvision.org/site/TR/GiftCatalog/GiftCatalog?px=1151804&pg=personal&fr_id=1660">World Vision Giving Portal</a>
and there will be opportunities to give at the reception.

See you in Colorado in two weeks!
