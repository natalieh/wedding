We have been married for a month!  Woohoo!!  Cory has finished moving in...sort of...and he started his new job a couple of weeks ago.  Marriage so far has been busy, sometimes stressful, but always good.  Personally, I am amazed by how God has used marriage to teach us to love each other more.  Some good friends said that we are now “Team Mead,” and every day God challenges us to cheer for each other and keep our eyes fixed upon Christ, the one who saves us and changes us.

We’re excited to get into the swing of things, and to report our not-so-recent discovery that you are amazing!  That’s right, we’re talking about you!  You celebrated our marriage with us, and many of you donated to our World Vision fund, which has now raised over $5,000 for World Vision!  This is more than double our original goal, and we will gladly match every penny.  Thank you for your heart for the poor and mistreated people of God’s world.  We promise to begin our marriage in a way that shows God’s redeeming, forever love to those near and far.  Please hold us to this promise to live the Good News of Christ’s sacrifice to make us right with and transformed by God.  We need you.

If you haven’t donated yet and you want to, be sure to do so soon so that we close down the page.
