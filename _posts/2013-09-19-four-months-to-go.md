This past weekend was what I would call a wedding planning extravaganza.  I flew out east to have a couple of days with my mother and future mother-in-law (and one of my four amazing bridesmaids, Grace).  We did wedding dresses, accessories, decorations, and many other things on the long wedding to-do list.  I am so excited for Cory to see this dress, and to be his wife!

After this, I drove up to Pittsburgh to spend a day with my fiance.  We were so glad to be together for this short time before I came back to California.  Talking and praying with Cory made me more excited than ever to marry him!  Wedding, here we come!
