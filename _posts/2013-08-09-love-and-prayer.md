This past month has been busy.

I proposed to Natalie about a month ago. That week was spent planning and spending as much time together as we could before
she flew back to Colorado the next week. The next day, my parents flew in to town. For the next week and a half,
I played host and tour guide, showing them around the city I will call home. After they left, my work exploded
with activity as the entire Argentina office was flown in for workshops, dinners, and special events. 
During all of this, Natalie and I were making wedding plans. Venues had to be arranged, pictures had to be taken for
Save-the-Dates, a guest list had to be compiled, and many other decisions had to be made!

And while all of the things that have happened in this past month have been good, I neglected one thing. My prayer
life was virtually non-existent. During the first month of this season of preparation, I went solo and didn't seek God for...
well, anything. Somewhere during all the business, I took God from the center of our relationship and replaced Him with her
(along with a generous helping of myself).

In the meantime, I was trying my best to love my new fiancee. You know, things like calling
just to say hello and tell her how beautiful she is and how much I'm in love with her. These things are really
good and important, but they were out of my own attempts at love, rather than Christ's love being displayed through me.
Instead of building her up, these words which were supposed to be filled with love were actually "clanging cymbals".
How can I speak to her with the love of Christ if I am not seeking and desiring that love myself on a regular basis?

One of the best things about being with a woman who is so in sync with the Spirit is that she notices
when I am out of sync. So, she lovingly called me out on it and told me that 
my empty expressions of love were lacking in the aspect that we care most deeply about--Jesus.

This past month, God has shown me once again how much I need Him. I need Him desperately to love Natalie in the
way she was created to be loved. I need Him to help me replace my broken human understanding of love 
(which is usually lust and sentimentality) with His all-encompassing, forever-enduring Love. It is this Love which is
embodied by Christ who, even when hounded by the masses, stole away to pray. A lot. 

And if Jesus needed time alone with God in order to love us so much, how can we hope to love anyone (I mean, really love them)
without spending lots of time in prayer?
