Q&A Time!  We have gotten some questions from friends lately about our marriage.  First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks to those who are not afraid to ask hard questions to Cory and myself.  A true friend bothers to ask us questions, because a true friend cares about whether or not we have considered the challenges that we are about to face.  

So, without further ado, here is a question we have received from multiple friends, and we choose to answer it in a semi-public setting so that you, as our friend, will know that we always want you to be a part of this journey we’re taking.

**Question: **
Why are you not living together until you get married?  What if you can’t stand living together?  That’s better to know ahead of time!

**Answer: **
Yes, Cory and I have actually taken up a practice of what I’d call anti-cohabitation, given that we plan to spend our entire engagement on different sides of the country!  What if, after we return from our honeymoon, we settle down in our apartment, and then realize that we drive each other crazy?  The answer that comes to mind is actually two answers:

1) We won’t be surprised.  This sounds a bit odd, but what I mean is that even if Cory and I have not lived together, that is not an indicator of how well we know each other.  We intentionally built our relationship upon honesty and transparency.  We have shared everything within reason about our lives, to the point that I claim to know Cory Mead better than anyone else on the planet does.  I know that he doesn’t pair up his socks when he folds his clothes.  I know that one of his biggest struggles is knowing how to be a good leader.  And not hitting the snooze button on his alarm in the morning.  We know each other well because that’s what we wanted from the start.  Many relationships start as fairly undefined, then evolve into marriage or “it’s complicated” or whatever else.  Our relationship didn’t start as such. We were both in the market for a 100% honest, in-your-face, in-your-life, forever friend.  And we’ve each found one.

OK, but what if we are wrong, and we needed more than intentionality to know if we can live well together?  What if we are both shocked to discover how hard it is to live together after we’re married?  Well...

2) We will get through it.   By this I’m saying that we believe that there is a loving Father God who “works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose” (Romans 8:28).     Cory and I are not so naive to think our marriage will be perfect, but we do believe that God can and will help us when things get hard.  So I’m not worried about whether or not our marriage will last, or if it will be good.  I am assured of God’s love for us daily by the knowledge of Christ’s sacrifice for sin and the Holy Spirit in me, and I trust that this God will guide our marriage through the inevitable hard times.  Trusting God with our marriage is not a cop-out-  having trust and faith is a profound struggle, but it’s a struggle that is well worth it.

Thanks for listening!  

Until next time,
Natalie
