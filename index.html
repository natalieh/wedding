    <p>
Thanks for celebrating this joyful time with us.  We believe in Jesus Christ and in his power to save and restore even the most messed up people, and our marriage stands as a testament to this!  As two sinners in need of a savior, we constantly learn about grace and love as we walk together.  It is our greatest honor to share our wedding with you, as we celebrate God's grace in our lives!
