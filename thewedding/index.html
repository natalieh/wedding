        We have chosen <a href="thechapelatredrocks.com" target="blank">The Chapel at Red Rocks</a> as the place where we will be married!  Bring your camera, as the chapel is known for its astounding views of <a href="http://www.redrocksonline.com/" target="blank">Red Rocks Park</a> and the Rocky Mountain front range.

    The Chapel at Red Rocks is located at <strong>905 Bear Creek Avenue, Morrison, Colorado</strong>.  Take C-470 to Morrison Road and travel west for less than a mile.  You will see the sign for the chapel on the right.
