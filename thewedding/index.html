        We have chosen <a href="http://www.chapelatredrocks.com" target="blank">The Chapel at Red Rocks</a> as the place where we will be married!  Bring your camera, as the chapel is known for its astounding views of <a href="http://www.redrocksonline.com/" target="blank">Red Rocks Park</a> and the Rocky Mountain front range.
