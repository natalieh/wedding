    <p>
        We believe that our wedding is about more than just us. We have been blessed beyond measure with gifts, talents,
        financial means, and one another! One of our highest aims in our marriage is to help one another to use these
        blessings to bless others.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this reason, we are partnering with <a href="http://www.worldvision.org/">World Vision</a>, a Christian
        humanitarian organization dedicated to improving the lives of people all over the world, regardless
        of religion, racial, or ethnic boundaries.
        World Vision seeks to deal with the root causes of poverty and injustice by meeting physical needs
        of communities in a sustainable way. <b>We support their vision, and we invite you to join with us!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        We ask you to consider making a donation to World Vision on our behalf in lieu of a traditional wedding gift while at our reception.
        To make your gift even more impactful, we are <b>fully matching</b> any gifts made, either through our
        <a href="http://support.worldvision.org/site/TR/GiftCatalog/GiftCatalog?px=1151804&pg=personal&fr_id=1660">
        online giving portal</a> or at the reception itself. We are doing this not out of obligation or
        because it's trendy, but because we have faith that our combined financial efforts can have a lasting
        impact on our world.
