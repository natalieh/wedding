                    We have done our best to make it easy for college students to come and celebrate with us.  Block hotel rooms are available to be shared with up to three people, and transportation options are available.  If you are interested in taking advantage of these money-saving choices, you can indicate your desire to enter a room and/or car share when you RSVP.
