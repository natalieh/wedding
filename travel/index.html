        The wedding will take place in the metro Denver area, so if you are traveling by air you should book tickets to Denver International Airport (DEN).  Taxis, rental cars and shuttles can be reserved or purchased upon your arrival.  Please note that the airport is a 30 minute drive from Denver and is even further from the wedding location.  Transportation options are available on the day of the wedding only for college students who cannot book rental cars.

        We have reserved a block of hotel rooms for our out-of-town guests at the <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/dentp-towneplace-suites-denver-southwest-littleton/">Marriott Towne Place Suites Littleton</a>.  The block reservation allows you to receive a discounted nightly rate when you book through the Hildebrandt/Mead wedding (more info soon).  If you are a college student who wants to share a room, please read the College Students section of this page.

    Colorado Traveling Tips

    <p>
        Colorado is the best place ever!  It's so great up here that you may get light-headed if you're not careful!  Do drink plenty of water throughout your stay.  Colorado weather is delightfully unpredictable, so be prepared for both snow and a warm, sunny day.  The weather forecast is not a guarantee, especially in the winter!  If you're into skiing or snowshoeing, you will find the nearby Rocky Mountains quite worth your time.  Have fun! :)

        We have done our best to make it easy for college students to come and celebrate with us.  Block hotel rooms are available to be shared with 4-5 other people, and transportation options are available for the day of the wedding.

        When you RSVP, you will have an opportunity to indicate your desire to share a hotel room.  If you have specific people in mind to share with, you may indicate that as well.  Please note that one person in each roommate group must make the actual hotel reservation, and splitting the nightly cost between everyone is up to you.  You will be able to decide who makes the booking after you RSVP and are set with your roommate group.

        You will also have an opportunity to request wedding-day transport when you RSVP.  Please do this only if you are not able to book a rental car.  All other transport during the weekend is up to you, but there are friends aplenty ;)

        Due to the number of people who will be traveling, we cannot officially offer you transport from or to the airport.  We do suggest <a href="www.supershuttle.com">Super Shuttle</a> and asking around to see if anyone you know will be able to drive you.  Also, do not hesitate to ask us closer to the event- we may be at the airport anyway!
